        <p>Apple is reportedly developing a new version of the Apple Watch SE that will feature a colorful plastic design, reminiscent of the iPhone 5c from 2013. According to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman, this upcoming model remains in the works despite facing some challenges related to cost and quality due to the shift from aluminum to plastic.<br><br>The new Apple Watch SE aims to be more affordable, potentially appealing to parent&#x27;s looking for a budget-friendly option for their children. Currently, the 2022 Apple Watch SE starts at $249 in the U.S., making it a mid-range choice among wearable devices. The inclusion of a plastic casing could help reduce production costs and offer a more vibrant and varied color palette.<br><br>In addition to the new design, the next Apple Watch SE is expected to come with a new chip, providing enhanced performance over its predecessor. This upgrade could bring faster processing speeds and improved functionality, making the watch more competitive in the market.<br><br>As Apple continues to refine this project, it&#x27;s likely that further details will emerge, potentially ahead of a planned release next year.</p>
