        <p>Flappy Bird, the viral mobile game that took the world by storm a decade ago, is making a comeback. Fans of the original game, under the newly formed Flappy Bird Foundation, have acquired the rights and are relaunching the title with new updates and features. Set to return as a native mobile app on iOS and Android in 2025, players will be able to enjoy the game even earlier this fall on desktop and mobile web platforms.<br><br>The revived version of Flappy Bird will stay true to its original design but with exciting additions, including new modes, characters, progression systems, and multiplayer challenges. The original game, known for its simple yet difficult gameplay and its crude art style, captivated more than 100 million players.<br><br>Flappy Bird first gained massive popularity in early 2014, but its creator, Dong Nguyen, ultimately removed it from app stores, citing concerns over its addictive nature. Now, a decade later, Flappy Bird is back, bringing with it the nostalgia of the original game alongside fresh content for both new and returning fans.</p>
