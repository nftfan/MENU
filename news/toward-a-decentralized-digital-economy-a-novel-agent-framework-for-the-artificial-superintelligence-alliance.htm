        <p>The current landscape of the Internet is dominated by a handful of monopolistic platforms, which often centralize services and create asymmetries between users and providers. This centralized model fosters winner-takes-all scenarios and limits the potential for innovation and fair competition. While multi-agent systems have been proposed, their adoption remain&#x27;s largely confined to niche applications.<br><br>In response to these challenges, we propose a novel agent framework designed to foster a decentralized digital economy. This framework envisions every individual and organization as an autonomous economic entity, each with its own agency. By leveraging distributed ledger technologies, the framework effectively bridges the gap between the traditional web and emerging decentralized systems.<br><br>Our implementation demonstrates strong performance characteristics, showcasing its scalability and efficiency. We highlight several application areas, illustrating how this framework can empower users, enhance collaboration, and create a more equitable digital economy. Through this innovative approach, we aim to unlock new opportunities for individuals and organizations alike, paving the way for a truly decentralized Internet within the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance.</p>
