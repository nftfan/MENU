This partnership was first hinted at nearly a year ago, with the recent confirmation shedding light on its potential.<br><br>Though details remain sparse, it has been revealed that the venture is backed by Ive and the Emerson Collective, the organization founded by Laurene Powell Jobs. Speculations suggest that the project could attract up to $1 billion in funding by year-end. Notably, previous reports indicated involvement from SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, though this has not been reaffirmed in the latest coverage.<br><br>The project currently employs ten individuals, including key figures from Ive&#x27;s iPhone team, Tang Tan and Evans Hankey. The design of the new device will be spearheaded by LoveFrom, Ive’s design firm, which operates from a newly acquired 32,000-square-foot office space in San Francisco.<br><br>Discussions between Ive and Altman have focused on leveraging generative AI to create a groundbreaking computing device that surpasses traditional software capabilities. While the device is rumored to draw inspiration from touchscreen technology and the original iPhone, many specifics, including its market launch, remain under consideration.<br><br>As the project develops, tech enthusiasts eagerly await more information on this innovative collaboration between two influential figures in the tech world.</p>
